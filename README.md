# Happy Thoughts

This is a project built in React where short messages are posted to a server and rendered on the website in a list.

## The problem

The App.js file fetches data from an API. 
Component Form posts a  message to the API.
Component Message renders new messages on website using useState.
A button on each message enables liking a message and counts how many likes it reveices.
